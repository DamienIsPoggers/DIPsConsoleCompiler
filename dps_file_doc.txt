		FF is archive of multiple files
	Bytes 7-10 are the number of entries
	Bytes 11-12 is the file version
	Bytes 13-14 is the size of the signiture (only weird string)
	Byte 15 (size changed by signiture size) is the file signiture
	Bytes 16 - 20 are null bytes


Script: (script entry is same as state/subroutine in bbscript)
	Byte 1 is the size of the entry name
	Bytes 2-X is the entry name
	Bytes 3-6 is the entry size (not including header)
	Byte 7 is if the entry is a subroutine or not
	Rest of entry is the commands

	Byte 6 is if the boxes/spheres are 3d
	Byte 7 is the loaded sprite/anim count
	(Byte 8 is the size of the next sprite
	Bytes 9 is the names of the sprites/anims) - these get repeted for every sprite/anim loaded
	Rest of entry is split up into Chunks then Boxes
	Chunk Bytes: (if calling an anim, chunks values dont affect how its rendered, but it's still required)
		Byte 1 is the number of the sprite/anim the chunk will use
